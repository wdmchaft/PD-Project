Hello,

Seven sagittal plane relative joint angles have been calculated at 150Hz. Those angles include: ankle, knee, hip (between pelvis and thigh), trunk (between thorax and pelvis),
neck, shoulder and elbow.  The data are entirely raw (i.e. unfiltered and no interpolation) so you may see missing data points in some trials.  

Each .txt file contains all trials for a particular joint angle for a given trial type and subject.  For example, a single file could contain 6 columns of 
data with the first being time and the remaining 5 being all trials of shoulder angles during forward long translations for a given subject.  
The timescale begins 500ms prior to platform translation onset (-500ms) and ends 2 seconds after platform onset.

Within a particular trialtype (i.e. bwdLONG) column numbers represent the same trial across all joint angles such that column #2 in bwdLONG shoulder angle 
and column #2 in bwdLONG ankle angle represent data from the same trial.  

Each file name contains the subject (i.e. Pilot03), the angle (i.e._Ankle_Angle_) and the trialtype (i.e. BdLgRch).

Trial type legend:
BdLgRch = backward long translation WITH reach
FdLgRch = forward long translation WITH reach
bwdSHRT = backward short translation
fwdSHRT = forward short translation
bwdLONG = backward long translation
fwdLONG = forward long translation
